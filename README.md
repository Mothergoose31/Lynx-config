# Lynx-config

Lynx is a text-based web browser that helps  minimize distractions.

## Setup

1. Configure lynx.conf to your liking
    ie : you need to change external  default brower that lynx opens.
    there are some websites that i would rather use in my default browser than lynx. in those instances press ',' to open the website in your default browser.

2. Run the setup script:
    ```
    ./setup
    ```
